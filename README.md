# Interactive Design - Assignment 1
Project Overview : 
To create an Augmented Reality Mobile Application to provide multiple interaction
points for engaging, facilitating or educating users with scenarios related to the
COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

# _How to use and run the application_
- From the Main Menu Screen there are 2 buttons "Food Menu" & "Fod Place" will bring you to their respective scenes based on the button pressed
- From the Food Menu Screen, scanning the "Food Menu" will make the AR Food Products appear. 
Clicking on the Food Products will bring up their respective Food Descriptions.
To scroll through the list on the Food Menu, click on the "Next Item" to swap through the list.
- From the Food Box Screen, users can place objects around by clicking in the areas indicated (by Vuforia).
The "Switch" button will toggle between the Mid Air Stage and Ground Plane Stages.
For Both Food Menu and Food Box, there will be a button at the top right which allows the users to toggle the camera on and off, while the button at the top left will bring the user back to the Main Menu Screen



# Platform/Hardware Required
- For Android : Android OS 11
- For Windows : Windows 64x

# Limitations/Bugs
This app is made as a school project and is not meant for proper usage in an actual F&B Outlet. 
It is merely a concept of a part of the Food Menu Ordering process to enhance User Immersion and Experiences. 
(E.g. The App Does not store any orders that have been made through the app)

Initially Planned to have a feature where users can hit food items around using the Vuforia Terrain, however that setup has been removed
